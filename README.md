# CNN-RNN-in-Record-Linkage
This project builds 5 neural network models to compare the performances of CNN and RNN used in record linkage and explore why their performances change in different datasets.

All of 5 experiment models are based on Siamese neural network. Siamese neural network is a type of architecture of neural network having two identical sub networks or called twin networks. The twin networks are implemented with any types of neural networks, such as full-connected layers, CNN and RNN.
